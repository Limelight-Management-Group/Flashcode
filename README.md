# Flashcode
Learn to code in a flash.


##Technologies Used

Flashcode uses jquery, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap, Css. 

##Approach Taken
I began by planning and wireframing the design of the app. I, then, began to write my user stories, so that I could sudo code and understand what would be neccessary to build the MVP. I chose to combine both JavaScript and jquery, because I wanted to include a bit of everything that we've learned in class--so far. jquery was required for add the functionality of the site; things like the queryselectors of the cards and displaying the results of the questions that have been answered.

##Installation Instructions
To contribute, you must have sass set up and the sass gen established. You must either download jquery and bootstrap or connect through a CDN. Fork and enjoy.

##Unsolved Probelems
I have not been able to store answers. Also, I am not able to log answers to more that one question at a time. The flashcards break, after more than two questions are stored. 

I was given a tremendous amount of support from #TeamGaia and help with logic from https://youtu.be/aXNobGI6sqY?list=PLD696766DF05BFDB7

The following is a link to my Trello board with my wireframe and user stories:
